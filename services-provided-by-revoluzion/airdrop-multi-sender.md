# Airdrop / Multi-Sender

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Airdrop / Multi-Sender Introduction</mark>

An "airdrop" is a term used in the cryptocurrency industry to describe the distribution of tokens to a large number of wallet addresses for free. It is often used as a marketing strategy to increase awareness and adoption of a particular token.&#x20;

A "multisender" is a tool or service that allows you to send varying amounts of cryptocurrency or tokens to multiple addresses at the same time. This can be useful for distributing tokens to a large group of individuals in different quantities, such as in the case of an airdrop where each individual receives a different amount of tokens.
