### <mark style="color:yellow;">What Is The Difference Between 3D NFT And 2D Artwork?</mark>

3D NFT artwork is a digital form of art that is created using 3D graphics software and is mostly used as NFT and stored on a IPFS blockchain. It is often used for creating immersive and interactive experiences, such as virtual reality or augmented reality artworks. 3D NFT artwork is unique in that it is non-fungible, meaning it cannot be exchanged for something else of equal value. This makes it a popular choice for collectors and investors.

On the other hand, 2D sketch artwork is a traditional form of art that is created using pencils, pens, or other drawing media on a flat surface. It is often used to create more realistic or lifelike depictions of subjects, and can be created in a wide range of styles and techniques. 2D sketch artwork is typically more accessible and affordable than 3D NFT artwork, as it does not require specialized software or hardware to create or display.
