There are several steps involved in the smart contract audit methodology:

1. Gathering information: This involves collecting all relevant information about the smart contract, including the code, design documents, and any other relevant materials.
2. Planning: The audit team will develop a plan for the audit, including the scope of the audit, the audit objectives, and the methods to be used.
3. Analysis: The audit team will analyze the smart contract code and any related documents to identify any potential issues or vulnerabilities.
4. Testing: The audit team will test the smart contract to ensure it functions as intended and to identify any issues or vulnerabilities that may not have been identified in the analysis phase.
5. Reporting: The audit team will prepare a report outlining the findings of the audit and any recommendations for improvement.
6. Remediation: If any issues or vulnerabilities are identified during the audit, the team will work with the client to develop a plan to address them.

Overall, the goal of the smart contract audit methodology is to ensure that the smart contract is secure, reliable, and effective.
