### <mark style="color:yellow;">Smart Contract Development Flow</mark>

The process of developing a smart contract typically involves the following steps:

1. Discussing with the client and define the requirements or needs that the smart contract will solve.
2. Research and choose the appropriate coding structure for the smart contract.
3. Design the smart contract's logic and functionality.
4. Write the code for the smart contract in the chosen programming language.
5. Test the smart contract thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning correctly and securely via Remix VM.
6. Deploy the smart contract to the testnet blockchain platform and do multiple testing.
7. Testing additional functions such as creating presale pool, finalizing and such.
8. Refine anything required and deliver to the client

After the initial development of the smart contract, Revoluzion will provide two additional revisition to refine and fine-tune anything that may be required to ensure that the final product meets the client's needs and expectations.&#x20;

At Revoluzion, we are dedicated to delivering the best possible results for our clients and are committed to refining and perfecting our work to ensure that the final smart contract is of the highest quality. Once all necessary refinements have been made, we will deliver the completed project to the client.
