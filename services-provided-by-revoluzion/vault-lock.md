# Vault / Lock

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Revoluzion Token Locking Vault Introduction</mark>

Revoluzion token locking vault is a type of smart contract that allows you to lock up a certain amount of your cryptocurrency tokens for a predetermined amount of time. Revoluzion vaults are typically used to demonstrate the long-term commitment of a project or organization to a particular cryptocurrency, as well as to help align the interests of token holders with those of the project.

Revoluzion token locking vaults work by allowing you to transfer your tokens to the smart contract, which then holds onto them for the specified period of time. The tokens are typically locked up for a year or more, and the terms of the lock-up period are usually clearly defined in the smart contract. Some token lock vaults may also include provisions for releasing a portion of the locked-up tokens at certain intervals, such as every quarter or every year.

Revoluzion token locking vaults can be useful for a variety of purposes, including providing liquidity for token holders, aligning the interests of token holders with those of the project, and demonstrating the long-term commitment of the project or organization to the cryptocurrency. However, it's important to carefully review the terms of the token lock vault before participating, as the terms can vary widely and may not always be favorable to token holders.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">What Can Revoluzion Token Locking Vault Do?</mark>

The Revoluzion token locking vault offers two types of vault functions: a standard locking period, or vesting over a specific time frame.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Standard Lock</mark>

* A standard locking period for a token vault is a fixed amount of time during which tokens are locked and cannot be accessed or transferred.&#x20;
* For example, a company may choose to lock tokens for a certain period of time to prevent market manipulation or to give early investors a chance to hold onto the tokens for a longer period.
* Locking periods can vary in length, but they are typically measured in days, weeks, or months. Once the locking period has ended, the tokens can be accessed and traded on the market.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Vesting Lock</mark>

* A vesting period for a token vault is a specific time frame during which tokens are released to the user in increments, rather than all at once.
* For example, a company may choose to vest tokens over a period of several years, releasing a certain percentage of the total tokens each month or year. This means that the user will not have access to all of their tokens immediately, but will receive them gradually over time.
* The vesting periods offered by Revoluzion are fully customizable, allowing users to select the length of the vesting period, the length of each release period, and the percentage of tokens released in each period.
