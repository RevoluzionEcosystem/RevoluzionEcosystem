# Web / dApp PenTest Audit

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Revoluzion Penetration Testing Assessment</mark>

Penetration testing, also known as "pen testing," is the practice of simulating a cyber attack on a computer system, network, or web application in order to identify vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. In the context of blockchain and decentralized applications, penetration testing can be used to identify weaknesses in the security of the blockchain or DApp that could be exploited by hackers or malicious actors.

Penetration testing of blockchain and decentralized applications typically involves simulating various types of attacks, such as network attacks, application layer attacks, in order to identify vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of the security measures in place. The results of the penetration test can then be used to improve the security of the blockchain or DApp and reduce the risk of successful attacks.
