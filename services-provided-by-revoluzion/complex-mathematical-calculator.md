### <mark style="color:yellow;">Calculation For DApps And Smart Contracts</mark>

Mathematical calculations can also be performed within smart contracts, in addition to the dApp itself. These calculations can be used for a variety of purposes, including gaming calculations such as randomizer calculations and minting probability calculations.

Some common types of calculations that Revoluzion can develop using code include:

* Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent
* Logarithmic and exponential functions
* Statistical calculations such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance
* Financial calculations such as present value, future value, and compound interest
* Scientific calculations such as unit conversions, physical constants, and algorithms for solving complex problems.

In addition to the various types of calculations mentioned earlier, we can also develop custom calculations according to the specific business logic provided by our clients. These calculations can include both precise and estimated calculations, depending on the needs of the client.
