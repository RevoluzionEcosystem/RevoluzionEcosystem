## <mark style="color:yellow;">Decentralized Application</mark>

Revoluzion offers a variety of function dApps to fit your project needs. These dApps, particularly those that support dividends, rebasing, and games, are essential for token holders and potential investors as they provide valuable metadata directly within the dApp.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">DApp Development Flow</mark>

The process of Revoluzion developing a decentralized application (dApp) typically involves the following steps:

1. Discuss with the client and define the requirement or need that the dApp will solve.
2. Research and choose the appropriate coding structure for the dApp.
3. Design the dApp's user interface and user experience.
4. Implement the smart contracts that will govern the dApp's functionality.
5. Test the dApp thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning correctly and securely.
6. Deploy the dApp to the chosen blockchain platform.
7. Maintain and update the dApp as needed.

It's important to note that the development process for dApps can vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project.&#x20;

Clients have the option to request specific services such as server hosting, coding type, or just a dApp interface without smart contracts, depending on their needs.
