# Decentralized Exchange Introduction

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Revoluzion (DEX) Introduction</mark>

Revoluzion decentralized exchange, or DEX, is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates on the Binance Smart Chain decentralized network, rather than a centralized server. This means that the exchange is not controlled by a single entity, but rather is run and maintained by a network of users.&#x20;

Revoluzion decentralized exchanges allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies without the need for a central authority, which can provide greater security and privacy for users. On a decentralized exchange, the fees for swapping a token may vary depending on the structure of the token's smart contracts.&#x20;

In contrast, on a centralized exchange, the fees for trading are typically fixed and are not tied to the specific smart contracts involved in the trade. This is because centralized exchanges typically handle trades off-chain, meaning that the transactions are not recorded on the blockchain.

Unlike many other decentralized exchange interfaces that rely on backend services provided by other DEXs such as PancakeSwap, Revoluzion DEX has its own unique structure that utilizes its own router, factory, and pair smart contracts. This means that the exchange is self-contained and does not rely on other DEXs for its operation.

Revoluzion DEX currently operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) but plans to expand to the Ethereum (ERC20) chain and potentially other blockchain networks in the near future.
