Revoluzion Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Swap is a platform that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency using a peer-to-peer model, rather than relying on a centralized exchange. This means that users can directly connect with each other to trade, rather than going through a middleman.

To use Revoluzion DEX, users must first connect their wallet. They can then browse available trading pairs and place orders to buy or sell specific tokens. The DEX platform will automatically match orders and facilitate the trade, with the exchange process being handled by smart contracts on the blockchain.

There are three tabs for Revoluzion DEX Swap tab:

Revoluzion DEX Swap is a simple and straightforward process. Here's how to use it:

1. In the top section, select the token you want to use for the swap from the drop-down list of tokens in your wallet.

3. In the bottom section, select the token you want to receive after the swap from the drop-down list.
4. If the desired token is not listed in the drop-down list, you can search for it using the search bar or paste the token's smart contract address.
5. Slippage is set to "auto" by default, but you can set your own preferred slippage if you wish (be aware that setting a slippage that is too low may cause the transaction to fail).
6. Review the details such as the minimum amount you will receive, the price impact, and the route.
7. If everything looks good, click "swap" and wait for the transaction to be processed on the blockchain.
8. You will now receive your desired token.
