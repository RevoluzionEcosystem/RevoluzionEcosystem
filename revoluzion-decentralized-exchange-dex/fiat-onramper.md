In order to comply with legal requirements, Revoluzion's fiat OnRamper service requires users to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This involves providing personal identification and other information to verify their identity. However, Revoluzion does not retain or have access to this information.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Revoluzion Fiat OnRamper FAQ</mark>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">What is Fiat OnRamper?</mark></summary>

Onramper is a ‘fiat onramp aggregator’ that aggregates multiple major fiat-to-crypto onramps in a single easy-to-implement fiat onramp. It means that businesses can integrate Onramper on their website and very easily allow their users to buy crypto using fiat.&#x20;

By aggregating multiple fiat onramps, Onramper ensures users will always get the best available price for any transaction. Aggregating the multiple onramps provides the best possible coverage of available fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, supported geographies, and payment methods.&#x20;

The user chooses what crypto he/she wants to buy, what fiat currency is used and what payment method he/she wants to buy it. Onramper then provides the user with a choice between the best available offers from the major fiat onramps. After the user chooses an onramp, he/she can fill in the personal information required by the chosen fiat onramp. Onramper sends all data inputted by the user to the onramp to complete the transaction.

_Note that Onramper does not itself convert any currencies._

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Can Onramper be used by anyone?</mark></summary>

Different fiat-crypto gateways allow (and disallow) users from different countries. While we aim to ensure users can buy cryptocurrency globally, we only work with fiat gateways that have implemented due diligence procedures, anti-fraud measures and KYC/AML policies. As such, users from a limited amount of ‘high-risk’ countries, such as Iran or North Korea, might not be able to use Onramper.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">How can I contact support?</mark></summary>

Support tickets can be opened with the fiat onramp (i.e. the seller) you used for your transaction.&#x20;

* First, check the status of your transaction. Depending on the onramp, this can be done using the link sent to you in the email sent to you when completing the transaction. &#x20;
* Secondly, check whether your question is answered on the FAQ page from the onramp (seller) you used. See the FAQ pages of [BTCDirect](https://support.btcdirect.eu/hc/en-gb),[ ](https://help.mercuryo.io/en/articles/3931686-transaction-questions)[Coinify,](https://help.coinify.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002499620-Buying-and-selling-cryptocurrency) [Indacoin](https://indacoin.com/faq), [Mercuryo](https://help.mercuryo.io/en/articles/4519473-mercuryo-widget-faq), [Moonpay](https://support.moonpay.io/hc/en-gb), [Utorg](https://utorg.pro/faq/), [Wyre](https://support.sendwyre.com/en/collections/2186435-wyre-widget), or [Xanpool](https://support.xanpool.com/hc/en-us).
* If the expected transaction time has elapsed and you can’t find what you’re looking for among the FAQ of your onramp (seller), please open a support inquiry with [**BTCDirect**](https://support.btcdirect.eu/hc/en-gb/requests/new)**,** [**Coinify,**](https://help.coinify.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) **** [**Indacoin**](https://onramper.com/faq-support/support@indacoin.com) **** [Moonpay](https://support.moonpay.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new), [Wyre](http://bit.ly/WyreSupport) or [**Xanpool.**](mailto:support@xanpool.com) **** If you’ve used [Mercuryo, please use the chat bubble on their website here](https://mercuryo.io/) and if you’ve used [Utorg, use the chat bubble on their website](https://utorg.pro/).

Revoluzion and OnRamper itself cannot help with support queries, as it is not involved with the transactions themselves, which means we cannot alter or cancel transactions and we do not have the information required to provide any updates on the status of transactions. Questions surrounding verification identification are handled by the onramp that takes care of the specific transaction.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">How long does it take before I receive my crypto?</mark></summary>

This depends on several factors, including the fiat gateway and the payment method used, as well as your location.

Generally, card payments are processed almost immediately. However, it’s common for some transactions to take a few hours. Bank transfers can take anywhere between 1 and 3 (business) days. The crypto is released once all fraud and KYC checks have been completed. For first-time transactions, this can take between a few minutes and a few hours, depending on additional verification that may be required. Most subsequent transactions will be processed within about 15 minutes.&#x20;

In cases of heavy network congestion (which can happen with Ethereum), the on-chain transaction might take longer to execute. Bitcoin generally takes up to an hour to arrive.

If it takes a lot longer to receive your cryptocurrency than described here, please open a support inquiry with [BTCDirect](https://support.btcdirect.eu/hc/en-gb/requests/new),  [Coinify,](https://help.coinify.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)  [Indacoin](https://onramper.com/faq/support@indacoin.com),  [Mercuryo](mailto:support@mercuryo.io), [Moonpay](https://support.moonpay.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new),  [Wyre](http://bit.ly/WyreSupport) or [Xanpool.](mailto:support@xanpool.com)&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Why did my order fail?</mark></summary>

You might have failed the identity check:\
Many sellers, such as Moonpay, require you to provide information on who you are, sometimes including an upload of your ID/passport. In case you do not pass this identity verification, your order will fail.

Additionally, your payment itself can fail for various reasons.&#x20;

If you’ve paid with a credit card, the most common reasons for failed orders are:

* you used someone else’s credit card or inputted the wrong billing address
* your issuing bank declined the credit card authorization
* your bank does not support crypto-acquisitions
* incorrect billing info

If you’ve paid with a bank transfer, the most common reasons for failed orders are:

* you’ve sent the transfer from someone else’s bank account
* you haven’t included the reference number provided to you&#x20;
* you have sent an incorrect amount

If payment itself fails, you can try to buy from another seller integrated with Onramper.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">How do I check the status of my transaction?</mark></summary>

This depends on the fiat gateway used for the transaction. Revoluzion and Onramper cannot help you in determining the status of your transaction as we are only the middleman that connects you to the fiat gateway. We do not have any insight into the status of your transaction.

In any case, you will receive an email from the fiat gateway you used, which contains information on your transaction. This email generally includes a link to check the status of your transaction.

Still feel like something is wrong? Please open a support inquiry with [BTCDirect](https://support.btcdirect.eu/hc/en-gb/requests/new),  [Coinify,](https://help.coinify.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)  [Indacoin,](https://onramper.com/faq/support@indacoin.com) [Mercuryo](mailto:support@mercuryo.io),  [Moonpay](https://support.moonpay.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new),  [Wyre,](http://bit.ly/WyreSupport) or [Xanpool.](mailto:support@xanpool.com)

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Can I cancel my transaction or get a refund?</mark></summary>

Once a transaction is initialized, refunds or cancellations are generally not available – although this is up to each individual fiat gateway. Revoluzion and Onramper is in no way involved with the transaction between you and the gateway. As such, see the terms of the gateway you transacted with.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Why did my credit card get charged for my order, but no crypto was delivered?</mark></summary>

When you choose a credit card as your payment method, and you place an order with Wyre or Moonpay, that party will put a temporary pre-authorisation on your card that sets aside the correct amount of funds for your transaction.

Unlike an actual transaction, a pre-authorisation does not take funds out of your account, it simply puts a hold on those funds until your transaction has been sent for processing.

Pre-authorisations will show up on your statement as “PENDING” and **are not** an actual charge.

**Why do we use pre-authorisations?**\
A pre-authorisation confirms your payment method is valid and operational, and that there are enough funds to cover the cost of the transaction, while other processes are finished (such as verifying that you are who you say you are).

**What happens if the transaction gets rejected after a pre-authorisation has been placed on my card?**\
If for some reason your transaction fails or is cancelled, the pre-authorisation will be cancelled.&#x20;

Depending on your bank, the pending transaction will just disappear the same day, but in some instances this can take up to 10 business days.&#x20;

Rest assured, you will never be charged for failed transactions and funds will never leave your account.

Still feel like something is wrong? Please open a support inquiry with [**BTCDirect**](https://support.btcdirect.eu/hc/en-gb/requests/new)**,** [**Coinify,**](https://help.coinify.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) **** [**Indacoin**](https://onramper.com/faq-support/support@indacoin.com) **** [Mercuryo](mailto:support@mercuryo.io), [Moonpay](https://support.moonpay.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new), [Wyre](http://bit.ly/WyreSupport) or [**Xanpool.**](mailto:support@xanpool.com)

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">My transaction has been processing for a long time. Is everything OK?</mark></summary>

If you paid with a credit card, your money doesn’t leave your account until the crypto is sent. If something goes wrong, the temporary charge placed on your card/account is removed.

If you’ve been waiting longer than expected, you can check the status of your transaction with the link sent to you by email (if supported by your chosen gateway). The transaction tracker will tell you if there are any extra steps needed, or if your payment method has been declined for any reason, and the order has failed.

It’s common for some transactions to take **a few hours** in the case of credit cards. When using bank transfers, transactions can take 1-3 days.

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Why do I have to verify my identity?</mark></summary>

Depending on the gateway you chose, verification of your identity is required by law in order to execute the conversion of fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies. This process exists to minimize the risk of suspicious transactions involved with money laundering or the financing of terrorism. Such customer due diligence and transaction monitoring are required by law in virtually any jurisdiction. Identity verification is done by the gateway you choose to buy cryptocurrency from.&#x20;

Transactions with Wyre do not require uploading a copy of your passport or identity document.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Why do I have to verify my ID again for a new transaction?</mark></summary>

Revoluzion and Onramper does not store any information that you fill in when transacting with a relevant gateway through our platform. The same applies to any documents or photos you might upload. Instead, everything is sent directly to the gateway that facilitates your transaction. As such, we cannot currently ensure that the same information and documentation can be re-used across various fiat gateways.

If we notice there is substantial demand for KYC re-use, we might build such functionality in the near-future.
