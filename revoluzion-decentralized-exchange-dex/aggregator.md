### <mark style="color:yellow;">Rubic & Revoluzion Security</mark>

Security is a top priority for Revoluzion and we strive to stand out in terms of security. We have integrated multiple bridges and DEXs to ensure that if one provider becomes unavailable, we can redirect users to a different working provider. Revoluzion and Rubic has a large infrastructure, team, and developer support that allows us to continually innovate and enhance the security of our platform. Revoluzion never stores user funds on our front-end and all transactions are conducted through Rubic's API calls to other smart contracts.

#### **Sustainability**

Due to the aggregation of 70+ bridges and DEXs, Rubic and Revoluzion guarantees swaps and sufficient liquidity for a swap even if some of the providers stop operating, run out of liquidity, or get hacked. Thanks to Rubic’s model architecture (Cross-Chain, On-Chain, Status Manager, Token Manager, Revert Manager), it continues to execute basic functions even if there’s something wrong with other modules.

#### **Decentralization**

Rubic and Revoluzion doesn’t exploit any external servers: _only Frontend and Blockchain_. This significantly decreases attack vectors (like DDOS). To find the best swap deal for most of the cross-chain and on-chain providers, Rubic appeals to the provider’s API, and then the data is processed through their services.

#### 24/7 Support and Auto-Refund Policy

Both Revoluzion and Rubic has 24/7 Live Support on Telegram, Discord, and built-in on our website. Also, we have a convenient auto-refund policy. In the case of specific transaction failures, Rubic’s team will complete your refund in the form of USDC tokens in 24 hours.

#### Open-Source Software

We’re built on open-source software: Our site, validators code, and smart contracts are publicly visible for maximum transparency (Github).

#### Rubic Security Measures

* Audits (CertiK and Fairyproof) Bug Bounty Program&#x20;
* Status Monitoring&#x20;
* Additional security practices: performance monitoring, accident management, and Rubic’s SDK Process Management.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Revoluzion & Rubic’s Security Pillars</mark>

#### Performance Monitoring

To ensure the high performance of Rubic’s cross-chain tools, Rubic’s team utilizes Provider/Blockchain Monitoring Dashboard, scores providers for stuck transactions, daily volume, refunds, and checks out SDK live status.&#x20;

Rubic utilizes automated tools for monitoring social networks for any potential risks with bridges or chains. If any issues arise, we use direct channels of communication with all bridges and providers to react quickly.

#### Accident Management

If any critical issue arises with one of Rubic’s integrated providers/blockchains, Rubic’s platform as well as Rubic’s SDK/Widget continue to function by taking the following measures: All of Rubic’s integrators are immediately notified (via Discord, Telegram).&#x20;

1. A compromised provider/bridge is paused in the smart contract and switched off for all integrators, whereas Rubic continues operating by redirecting transactions to other providers.
2. In case of any issues with Rubic’s SDK, Rubic takes the same actions — immediate notification of its integrators and switching off of the compromised provider/bridge. Rubic’s technical support is also ready to assist 24/7.
