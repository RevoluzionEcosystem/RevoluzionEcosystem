2. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Select Network**</mark>: You will need to select the currency you want to use for the payment. If you want to use BUSD, make sure you are on the correct network, which is the Binance Smart Chain BEP20.

5. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Approve Allowance**</mark>: Every payment requires an allowance approval that is set to the specific amount that the user wants to pay and never more than that.
