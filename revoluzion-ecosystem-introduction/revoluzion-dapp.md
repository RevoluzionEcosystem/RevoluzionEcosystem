# Revoluzion DApp

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Revoluzion DApp</mark>

The Revoluzion dApp is developed using NextJS with TypeScript and Vercel for server-side rendering. The combination of NextJS and Vercel is a state-of-the-art solution for Web3 dApp development, offering security, high performance, and advanced features.&#x20;

By using NextJS and Vercel, all rendering is performed on the server side rather than the client side, resulting in fast navigation and improved user experience, particularly for users with low internet speeds. Overall, the use of NextJS and Vercel in the Revoluzion dApp offers a superior development platform for Web3 applications.
